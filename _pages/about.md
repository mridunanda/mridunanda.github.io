My name is Mridu and I am a fourth year CS PhD student advised by [Mike Reiter](https://reitermk.github.io/) at Duke University. I am broadly interested in systems security research and my current work is focused on passwords. 

Before Duke, I received my bachelor's degree in computer science (and minor in math) from Harvard University, where I worked with [James Mickens](https://mickens.seas.harvard.edu/).


Research
------


In a previous life, I was interested in computational biology, specifically cancer modeling. I was fortunate to be advised by [Rick Durrett](https://services.math.duke.edu/~rtd/). Here are the projects we worked on:
- **Spatial evolutionary games with weak selection.**<br/>
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), 2017<br/>
**Mridu Nanda**, Rick Durrett.<br/>

- **Genotype Patterns in Growing Solid Tumors.**<br/>
bioRxiv preprint, 2020 <br/>
**Mridu Nanda**, Rick Durrett.<br/>
