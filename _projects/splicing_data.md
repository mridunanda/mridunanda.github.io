title: "Splicing Data from a Multi-User Application"
description: "In this project we aim to provide systems level support for applications to efficiently
implement ”the right to erasure” as outlined in the General Data Protection Regulation
(GDPR). As a starting point, we study a spreadsheet application which provides sim-
ple yet nontrivial semantics. We define deletion semantics for standard spreadsheet
functions to ensure that functions evolve in a way that preserve the functionality of
the application We also support efficient deletion by introducing aggregation points,
function decomposition and coalescing. We attempt to show that a spreadsheet appli-
cation can be used to represent a database for a higher level application. To do so, we
create spreadsheet functions to represent a list data structure and list operations. We
then create a mapping between Trello, a workflow application, and our spreadsheet,
and conclude that Trello is amenable to spreadsheet-like deletion semantics.

I worked on this project with James Mickens and was funded by the Hershel Smith Undergraduate Research Fellowship and PRISE (Program for Research in Science and Engineering) Fellowships."
