title: "Splicing Data from a Multi-User Application"
description: | 
"The aim of this project was to provide system-level support for applications to efficiently implement "the right to erasure" as outlined in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). As a starting point, I designed an efficient and scalable infrastructure based on a spreadsheet’s computational model to offer developers deletion-aware storage abstractions. The key challenge was designing these primitives to preserve the semantic integrity of data after deletion.

I worked on this project with James Mickens and was funded by the Hershel Smith Undergraduate Research Fellowship and PRISE (Program for Research in Science and Engineering) Fellowships."
