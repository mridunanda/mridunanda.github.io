title: "Making Trust Explicit in XOS"
description: "This project was completed as part of [Eddie Kohler's CS 261: Research Topics in Operating Systems class](https://read.seas.harvard.edu/cs261/2021/). The goal was to propse a new operating system or OS subsystem. I designed XOS, a novel operating system that enforces the principle of least privilege (PoLP) at the application level. Specifically, XOS allows processes to access resources based on their trustworthiness, restricting the default access to system resources (e.g., CPU, memory, ports) for each application."
