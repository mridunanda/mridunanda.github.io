title: "Reproducing Crash Consistency Experiments with ALICE"
description: "The goal of this project was to reproduce one or more experiments from a previously published systems paper. We reproduced experiments from "Application Crash Consistency and Performance with CCFS," which presents a new file system, CCFS, designed to improve application crash consistency. Using the ALICE tool, we tested the behavior of an application under different filesystem guarantees and compared our findings with those from the original paper.

This project was completed as part of [Eddie Kohler's CS 261: Research Topics in Operating Systems class](https://read.seas.harvard.edu/cs261/2021/)."
