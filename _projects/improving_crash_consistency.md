title: "Improving Application Crash Consistency with Symbolic Execution and Fuzzing"
description: "A variety of record-and-replay tools examine application crash consistency bugs, but they are limited by the diversity of the workloads used for testing. In this project, we hypothesize that a more diverse and robust workload will allow these tools to find a greater number of application-level crash consistency bugs. To test this hypothesis, we compared the bugs found in three applications found by KLEE-generated workloads against workloads generated by  our custom grammar-based fuzzer.


This project was completed as part of [Eddie Kohler's CS 261: Research Topics in Operating Systems class](https://read.seas.harvard.edu/cs261/2021/)."
