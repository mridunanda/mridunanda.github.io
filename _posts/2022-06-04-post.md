I got back from the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) conference yesterday. This conference is really only meant for PIs, but since Mike was one of the co-organizers, our lab group got to tag along. As students, our role was to make sure the conference ran smoothly. Mike bought all the student volunteers black tshirts labeled "Security" so that we would be easy to spot.

Overall, I thought the conference was a fun experience. My volunteer role involved helping with poster presentation setups, and to keeping track of time during the keynote talks. These were the optimal tasks to help with, since I got a chance to talk to PIs and listen to talks. I also took some scribe notes for a [breakout session](/files/SaTC__Game_Theory_and_Distributed_System_Security.pdf), and [BoF session](/files/SaTC__BOF_Conference_Review_Process.pdf). The conference was also a great time to bond with my labmates, since we don't see eachother often in the office (people are still working mostly remotely, due to the pandemic).
